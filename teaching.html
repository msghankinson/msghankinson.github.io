<h3>PSC 2211: State and Urban Politics</h3>

<p>This course will introduce you to the mechanics and politics of states and local government in the United States. We will begin by surveying what state and local governments actually control: what they spend on and how they raise that revenue. Next, we will unpack what social science can tell us about who gets what and why in the state and local context. Finally, we will explore specific policy areas, addressing current debates using the social science lens we've developed. Along the way, you will write a policy paper on a topic of your choice using political science theory to understand why things may be broken and how to help fix them.
