 <h3>PSC 3192w: Infrastructure: Inaction &amp; Inequality</h3>

<p>How should we decide where to put things society needs, but few people want nearby? In this writing seminar, we will focus on the political challenge of infrastructure in the United States. Infrastructure is broadly defined, but we will focus primarily on the supply of market-rate and affordable housing, as well as clean energy infrastructure. The political challenge at hand is how to provide infrastructure but also ensuring equity in its distribution of costs and benefits. Having defined normative goals, we will review the political hurdles to its provision, from the behavior of political actors to the institutional designs which create challenges.

<h3>PSC 2211: State and Urban Politics</h3>

<p>This course will introduce you to the mechanics and politics of states and local government in the United States. We will begin by surveying what state and local governments actually control: what they spend on and how they raise that revenue. Next, we will unpack what social science can tell us about who gets what and why in the state and local context. Finally, we will explore specific policy areas, addressing current debates using the social science lens we've developed. Along the way, you will write a policy paper on a topic of your choice using political science theory to understand why things may be broken and how to help fix them.
