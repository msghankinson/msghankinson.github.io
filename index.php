I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/christopher-warshaw" target="_blank">Political Science</a> at <a href="https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu" target="_blank">George Washington University</a>. Previously, I was an Associate Professor (without tenure) at <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu" target="_blank">the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.  My areas of research are American Politics, Representation, Public Opinion, State and Local Politics, Environmental Politics and Policy, and Statistical Methodology.  

<p>One of the most profound questions in the study of democratic governance is whether the government is responsive to the preferences of its citizens and how the influence of the mass public varies across institutional contexts and over time.  In my research, I evaluate the links between public opinion, elections, and political outcomes in city and state governments, as well as the U.S. Congress. I also examine how political institutions, such as term limits or direct democracy, influence political representation.  In order to do this, I have developed new techniques to accurately measure the policy preferences of the American public at a variety of geographic levels. I have published my work in the <i>American Political Science Review</i>, the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, the <i> Annual Review of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Analysis</i>, <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, <i>Legislative Studies Quarterly</i>, the <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Behavior</i>, <i>Public Choice</i>, the <i>Election Law Journal</i>, <i>Nature Energy</i>, and edited volumes from Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press. My non-academic writing has also been published in the <i>New York Times</i> Upshot and the <i>Washington Post</i> Monkey Cage.

<p>In addition to my research on representation, I have written on a wide range of topics in political science including: survey design, energy policy, judicial politics, and the institutional underpinnings of democratization. During <a href='https://politicalscience.stanford.edu'>graduate school</a>, I was a research fellow at Stanford's <a href='http://pesd.stanford.edu/' target="_blank">Program on Energy and Sustainable Development (PESD)</a>. Prior to graduate school, I worked in politics for two years and as an <a href="http://www.indecon.com">environmental economics</a> analyst for two years.  I received a B.A. in Economics and Political Science from <a href='http://www.williams.edu' target="_blank">Williams College</a>.
