			<p>I am an Assistant Professor at George Washington University. At Cornell, I will be working in the <a href="https://government.cornell.edu/">Department of Political Science</a>. At Maxwell, I will be a part of the Department of Political Science and an affiliate of the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/autonomous-policy/">Autonomous Systems Policy Institute</a>. I am also a research affiliate with the <a href="https://governance.ai/">Centre for the Governance of AI</a> at the University of Oxford.</p>

			<p>My current research focuses on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, I study public and elite opinion toward AI and how the American welfare state could adapt to the increasing automation of labor. My previous research covered a wide range of topics, including the politics of the U.S. welfare state, attitudes towards climate change, and survey methodology.</p>

            <p>I graduated with a PhD in political science (2017) from Harvard University. In 2019-2020, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in MITâ€™s <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/">Political Science Department</a> and a fellow at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University.</p>
