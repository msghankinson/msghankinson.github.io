				I am a political scientist studying how institutional spatial scale affects political behavior to undermine democratic representation. I use original data to show that collective outcomes in housing, health policy, and voting behavior are all shaped by the spatial scale of institutions.</p>

			<p>
				Methodologically, I leverage geocodable observational data as well as original survey and experimental approaches.
