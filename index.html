				I am an <a href="https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/michael-hankinson">Assistant Professor of Political Science</a> at the <a href="https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a>. I study American politics, with a focus on political behavior, representation, local politics, and inequality. Specifically, I use original data to show how collective outcomes in housing, health policy, and voting behavior are all shaped by the spatial scale of institutions.</p>

			<p>
				Methodologically, I leverage geocodable observational data as well as original survey and experimental approaches. My research has been published in the <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>The Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Political Behavior</i>, <i>Social Forces</i>, and <i>Urban Affairs Review</i>.</p>
			
			<p>	
				 Prior to joining the George Washington University, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Baruch College, City University of New York and prior to that I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Politics at Oberlin College. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/programs-of-study/all/social-policy">Government and Social Policy</a> from Harvard University and my B.A. in <a href="https://politics.virginia.edu/">Political Science</a> and <a href="https://etp.virginia.edu/">Environmental Thought & Practice</a> from the University of Virginia. </p>
